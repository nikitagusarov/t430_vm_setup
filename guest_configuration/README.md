# Client configuration 

Client configuration is separated into two parts, as *Linux* and *Windows* have separate procedures for client configuration, even though some steps are common between them.

This part is organised as following :

1. *Linux* system (here we are going to install *Ubuntu 20.04*)
2. *Windows 10* system
