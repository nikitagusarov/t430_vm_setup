# Linux system 

The installation process identical to host system installation.
The desktop environment we choose shoul afford maximum flexibility and productivity, beeing at the same time not too dependent on ressources (mostly graphical).
Here our options are :

- GNOME (may be optimal choice allowing for similar workflow to host system in DE mode)
- KDE (more options and flexibility)
- Cinnamon 
- Xfce (less ressources greedy)
- Lxde
